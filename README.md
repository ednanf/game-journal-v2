# Game Journal V2

## Notes

- The backend is hosted on Render and takes a moment to wake up after periods
  of inactivity. Please allow time for the server to respond on your first
  request.
- Currently, the auth token is stored in local storage instead of cookies to
  avoid CORS complications, particularly with WebKit on iOS.
